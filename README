This just a simple set of scripts to rebuild a known working kernel for ARM devices..

Weakly Support Boards:

Dependencies: GCC ARM Cross ToolChain

Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

Linaro:
http://www.linaro.org/downloads/

Angstrom:

Dependencies: Linux Kernel Source

This script needs a local copy of the mainline kernel source. Using that local copy, this script will then pull specific tags/trees/commits from kernel.org.  For example, to clone this local copy into your user directory:

cd ~/
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git

Then update "LINUX_GIT" to "LINUX_GIT=~/linux-stable/" in system.sh to point to your new local kernel source copy.

Build: zImage/Modules:

"./build_kernel.sh"

Install to SD card: zImage/Modules:

"./tools/install_image.sh"

Build: Debian deb package:

"./build_deb.sh"

Hacking: Made some some changes but don't want to rebuild the whole tree:

zImage/Modules:
"./tools/rebuild.sh"

Deb:
"./tools/rebuild_deb.sh"
