###ADVANCED, OPTIONAL: gcc version override (useful for gcc/kernel regressions)
#GCC_OVERRIDE="gcc-4.4"

#ARM Native gcc compiler (running gcc on arm target)

###REQUIRED:

#ARM GCC CROSS Compiler: (See hints in Readme, for different gcc cross compiler versions)
#CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-

##Linux Kernel Source location:
##
##This script will clone torvalds linux git tree from kernel.org.  From this git tree
##this script can generate a prinstine starting point before running the patch.sh script.
##
##For most users, the default will work fine, for other kernel developers who have
##already cloned torvalds tree, and would like to safe file space, just define LINUX_GIT in this file.
##
##git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git ${HOME}/
#
#LINUX_GIT=${HOME}/linux-stable/

###OPTIONAL: (REQUIRED FOR RUNNING: ./tools/install_image.sh)

##Since 2.6.39?, it's now possible to build a Linux Kernel for devices that have
##different physical address of the kernel entry point or "ZRELADDR".  This also means
##these scripts only create zImage's, if you'd like uImage, run mkimage yourself, or use
##the ./tools/load_uImage.sh to load the uImage on a MMC card.

##For TI: OMAP3/4/AM35xx
#ZRELADDR=0x80008000

##For Freescale:
##MX51 Family
#ZRELADDR=0x90008000

##MX53
#ZRELADDR=0x70008000

##MX6
#ZRELADDR=0x10008000

###ADVANCED: Allow the script to build uImage's directly, so-far safe for TI OMAP, but not Freescale..
#BUILD_UIMAGE=1

###OPTIONAL: (REQUIRED FOR RUNNING: tools/install_image.sh )
##Note: This operates on raw disks, NOT PARTITIONS
##WRONG: MMC=/dev/mmcblk0p1
##CORRECT: MMC=/dev/mmcblk0
##WRONG: MMC=/dev/sde1
##CORRECT: MMC=/dev/sde

#MMC=/dev/sde

###ADVANCED: Secret Sauce Patches:

##Have some secret sauce, you dont want to share with the community??
##
##It'll look specifically for *.patch files... Doesn't care about order/etc.. And I don't care about enhancing it.. ;)

#LOCAL_PATCH_DIR=/full/path/to/dir/

###ADVANCED: Pull in Torvalds current master tree before applying local patchset
#This is very useful during an intial 'rc0' merge.
#It is never supported... Enable at your own risk
#LATEST_GIT=1

###ADVANCED: enable DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH
#http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH.html
#DEBUG_SECTION=1

###ADVANCED: run git bisect
#RUN_BISECT=1
